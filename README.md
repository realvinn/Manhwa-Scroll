# Auto-Scroller README

## Why I Made This Thing

Honestly, I was just too annoyed to scroll manually. I mean, who hasn't been there? You're trying to read a manhwa (or manga), and your finger gets tired from scrolling. Yeah, it's a real problem.

So, I made this auto-scroller thingy. It's still early access (version 0.2, baby!), but it gets the job done.

## What It Can Do

This app can:

* Auto-scroll for you, so you don't have to lift a finger (literally)
* Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect text and adjust scrolling speed accordingly
* Let you select a screen region for OCR, so it doesn't accidentally read other words
* Start and stop auto-scrolling with a simple mouse click or key press

## Features

* Adjustable scrolling speed (because, let's face it, sometimes you need to slow down or speed up)
* Customizable OCR region (because, you know, not everyone wants to read the whole screen)

## Known Issues

* It's still early access, so there might be some bugs (sorry ðŸ¥º)
* The app might not work perfectly with all screen resolutions or orientations (working on it, though!)

## Future Plans

* Add more features (duh!)
* Improve performance and stability (yawn, but necessary)
* Make it look prettier (because, let's face it, looks matter)

## How to Use

1. Run the app (obviously)
2. Select a screen region for OCR (if you want to)
3. Click the "Start Auto-Scroll" button (or press the middle mouse button, or press a key... you get the idea)
4. Enjoy the auto-scrolling goodness!

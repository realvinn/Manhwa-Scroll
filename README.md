## Why I Made This Thing

Honestly, I was just too annoyed to scroll manually. I mean, who hasn't been there? You're trying to read a manhwa (or manga), and your finger gets tired from scrolling. Yeah, it's a real problem.

So, I made this auto-scroller thingy. It's still early access (version 0.21, baby!), but it gets the job done.

## What It Can Do

This app can:

* Auto-scroll for you, so you don't have to lift a finger (literally)
* Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect text and adjust scrolling speed accordingly
* Let you select a screen region for OCR, so it doesn't accidentally read other words
* Start and stop auto-scrolling with a simple mouse click or key press

## Features

* Adjustable scrolling speed (because, let's face it, sometimes you need to slow down or speed up)
* Customizable OCR region (because, you know, not everyone wants to read the whole screen)

## Known Issues

* It's still early access, so there might be some bugs (sorry ðŸ¥º)
* The app might not work perfectly with all screen resolutions or orientations (working on it, though!)

## Future Plans

* Add more features (duh!)
* Improve performance and stability (yawn, but necessary)
* Make it look prettier (because, let's face it, looks matter)

## How to Use
1. Change settings as needed and click 'Update Settings'
2. Select the screen region for OCR (this is required).
3. To start auto-scroll, press the middle mouse button.
4. To stop auto-scroll, click any other mouse button or press any key.
5. Enjoy the auto-scrolling goodness!
